# Shuffle Your Deck!
As shown in the figure, this software displays the shuffled deck list and initial hand by inputting the MO deck list, selecting the shuffle to be performed, and pressing the button.

Currently, only Hindu shuffle and deal shuffle are supported, but other shuffle methods will be supported in the future.


## What is needed to running this code?
This code is executed using the following external packages. Please install them in your own execution environment if necessary.
- wxPython 4.2.1
- [scrython 1.11.0](https://github.com/NandaScott/Scrython)



## Cautions on Use
This software uses the [API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) provided by [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/) to retrieve card images, and  although no clear value for RateLimit is provided, it is estimated to be around 10 requests/s.  Please avoid excessive shuffling, such as hitting the shuffle button repeatedly. I plan to fix this problem soon by retaining the card information once acquired until the software is terminated.
